Hello! I am Zihan Chen (陈子晗), a second-year PhD student in the ECE department at [UVa](https://engineering.virginia.edu/department/electrical-and-computer-engineering), where I am fortunate to be advised by Professors [Jundong Li](https://jundongli.github.io/) and [Cong Shen](https://cshen317.github.io/). Previously, I received my M.Sc. degree in Data Science in 2023 and my B.Sc. degree in Mathematics in 2020, both from the University of Science and Technology of China. My current research focuses on enhancing the **efficiency of LLMs**, particularly through the design of algorithms for in-context learning that prioritize high-quality demonstrations and address challenges in resource-constrained environments. I also have experience in LLM quantization, where I employ mixed-precision techniques to improve the performance of quantized models. Additionally, I have a broad interest in federated learning, graph learning, and machine unlearning.
