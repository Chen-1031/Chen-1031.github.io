Hello! I am Zihan Chen (陈子晗), a second-year PhD student in the ECE department at [UVa](https://engineering.virginia.edu/department/electrical-and-computer-engineering), where I am fortunate to be advised by Professors [Jundong Li](https://jundongli.github.io/) and [Cong Shen](https://cshen317.github.io/). Previously, I received my M.Sc. degree in Data Science in 2023 and my B.Sc. degree in Mathematics in 2020, both from the University of Science and Technology of China. My current research focuses on **federated learning** and **in-context learning**.  I am particularly interested in designing algorithms for federated learning on graph data and selecting high-quality demonstrations for in-context learning. I also have broad interests in **machine unlearning**.
